          <source>Each entry in the aPgno array has a single corresponding entry in the aHash array. There are more available slots in aHash than there are in aPgno. The unused slots in aHash are filled with zero. And since there are guaranteed to be unused slots in aHash, that means the loop that computes X is guaranteed to terminate. The expected size of X is less than 2. The worst case is that X will be the same as the number of entries in aPgno, in which case the algorithm runs at about the same speed as a linear scan of aPgno. But that worst case performance is exceedingly rare. Usually, the size of X will be small and the use of the aHash array allows one to compute FindFrame(P,M) much faster.</source>

          <source>Enterprise-class client/server SQL database engines do not normally make this guarantee. In client/server SQL database engines, the server keeps track of statistics on the sizes of tables and on the quality of indexes and the query planner uses those statistics to help select the best plans. As content is added, deleted, or changed in the database, the statistics will evolve and may cause the query planner to begin using a different query plan for some particular query. Usually the new plan will be better for the evolving structure of the data. But sometimes the new query plan will cause a performance reduction. With a client/server database engine, there is typically a Database Administrator (DBA) on hand to deal with these rare problems as they come up. But DBAs are not available to fix problems in an embedded database like SQLite, and hence SQLite is careful to ensure that plans do not change unexpectedly after deployment.</source>

In SQLite, the compiled form of statements is a short program in a machine-language like representation. Users of the database can view this &lt;a href=&quot;opcode&quot;&gt;virtual machine language&lt;/a&gt; by prepending the &lt;a href=&quot;lang_explain&quot;&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/a&gt; keyword to a query.</source>

It is possible (and in fact rather common) to have a complete b-tree that consists of a single page that is both a leaf and the root. Because there are pointers from parents to children, every page of a complete b-tree can be located if only the root page is known. Hence, b-trees are identified by their root page number.</source>

          <source>Except for &lt;a href=&quot;withoutrowid&quot;&gt;WITHOUT ROWID&lt;/a&gt; tables, all rows within SQLite tables have a 64-bit signed integer key that uniquely identifies the row within its table. This integer is usually called the &quot;rowid&quot;. The rowid value can be accessed using one of the special case-independent names &quot;rowid&quot;, &quot;oid&quot;, or &quot;_rowid_&quot; in place of a column name. If a table contains a user defined column named &quot;rowid&quot;, &quot;oid&quot; or &quot;_rowid_&quot;, then that name always refers the explicitly declared column and cannot be used to retrieve the integer rowid value.</source>

          <source>Except for the WHERE clause, the structure of the program for this example is very much like the prior example, just with an extra column. There are now 3 columns, instead of 2 as before, and there are three ColumnName instructions. A cursor is opened using the OpenRead instruction, just like in the prior example. The Rewind instruction at address 6 and the Next at address 17 form a loop over all records of the table. The Close instruction at the end is there to give the Rewind instruction something to jump to when it is done. All of this is just like in the first query demonstration.</source>

SQLite implements serializable transactions by actually serializing the writes. There can only be a single writer at a time to an SQLite database. There can be multiple database connections open at the same time, and all of those database connections can write to the database file, but they have to take turns. SQLite uses locks to serialization of the writes automatically; this is not something that the applications using SQLite need to worry with.</source>

The pointer generated by the MATCH operator has a type of &quot;fts3cursor&quot; but the carray() function expects to receives a pointer of type &quot;carray&quot;. Because the pointer type on the &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/result_blob&quot;&gt;sqlite3_result_pointer()&lt;/a&gt; does not match the pointer type on the &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/value_blob&quot;&gt;sqlite3_value_pointer()&lt;/a&gt; call, &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/value_blob&quot;&gt;sqlite3_value_pointer()&lt;/a&gt; returns NULL in carray() and thus signals the CARRAY extension that it has been passed an invalid pointer.</source>

          <source>FTS is primarily designed to support Boolean full-text queries - queries to find the set of documents that match a specified criteria. However, many (most?) search applications require that results are somehow ranked in order of &quot;relevance&quot;, where &quot;relevance&quot; is defined as the likelihood that the user who performed the search is interested in a specific element of the returned set of documents. When using a search engine to find documents on the world wide web, the user expects that the most useful, or &quot;relevant&quot;, documents will be returned as the first page of results, and that each subsequent page contains progressively less relevant results. Exactly how a machine can determine document relevance based on a users query is a complicated problem and the subject of much ongoing research.</source>

          <source>FTS queries are made up of &lt;b&gt;phrases&lt;/b&gt;. A phrase is an ordered list of one or more tokens.

The most common (and effective) way to describe full-text searches is &quot;what Google, Yahoo, and Bing do with documents placed on the World Wide Web&quot;. Users input a term, or series of terms, perhaps connected by a binary operator or grouped together into a phrase, and the full-text query system finds the set of documents that best matches those terms considering the operators and groupings the user has specified.

The search functionality provided to world wide web users by &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqlite.org/www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is, among other things, a full-text search engine, as it allows users to search for all documents on the web that contain, for example, the term &quot;fts5&quot;.</source>

Nobody really believes that OpenDocument should be changed to use SQLite as its container instead of ZIP. Nor is this article a criticism of OpenDocument for not choosing SQLite as its container since OpenDocument predates SQLite. Rather, the point of this article is to use OpenDocument as a concrete example of how SQLite can be used to build better application file formats for future projects.</source>

          <source>Flexible typing is considered a feature of SQLite, not a bug. Nevertheless, we recognize that this feature does sometimes cause confusion and pain for developers who are acustomed to working with other databases that are more judgemental with regard to data types. In retrospect, perhaps it would have been better if SQLite had merely implemented an ANY datatype so that developers could explicitly state when they wanted to use flexible typing, rather than making flexible typing the default. But that is not something that can be changed now without breaking the millions of applications and trillions of database files that already use SQLite's flexible typing feature.</source>

A constraint of the form &quot;left.x=right.y&quot; in an ON clause will therefore allow through the added all-NULL rows of the right table.

          <source>For an inner join, the two queries above would be identical. But special processing applies to the ON and USING clauses of an OUTER join: specifically, the constraints in an ON or USING clause do not apply if the right table of the join is on a null row, but the constraints do apply in the WHERE clause. The net effect is that putting the ON or USING clause expressions for a LEFT JOIN in the WHERE clause effectively converts the query to an ordinary INNER JOIN - albeit an inner join that runs more slowly.</source>

          <source>For any given SQL statement, there might be hundreds or thousands or even millions of different algorithms of performing the operation.

          <source>For any given query, the fact that the OR-clause optimization described here can be used does not guarantee that it will be used. SQLite uses a cost-based query planner that estimates the CPU and disk I/O costs of various competing query plans and chooses the plan that it thinks will be the fastest. If there are many OR terms in the WHERE clause or if some of the indices on individual OR-clause subterms are not very selective, then SQLite might decide that it is faster to use a different query algorithm, or even a full-table scan. Application developers can use the &lt;a href=&quot;lang_explain&quot;&gt;EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN&lt;/a&gt; prefix on a statement to get a high-level overview of the chosen query strategy.</source>
